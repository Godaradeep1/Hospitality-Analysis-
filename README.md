# Problem Statment

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Learned things from this Project
Learned to build a new visual (Calendar visual) using a matrix table, which can be utilized for different purposes of analysis.

By referring to different cancellation policies followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fees, only if the booking is canceled before three months of the booking date. If the booking is canceled after that, the charge ranges from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.

Learn, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection. 

Tried using the color palette and sticking with those colors throughout the dashboard.
